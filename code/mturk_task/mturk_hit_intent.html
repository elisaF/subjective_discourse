	<h><strong>Goal of study:</strong></h>
	<p>In this study, we are analyzing the questioning of witnesses in U.S. congressional hearings. We are interested in understanding <strong><em>how audiences (you) perceive intent in argumentative conversations</em></strong>, and <strong><em>how that perception changes</em></strong> depending on the personal beliefs of different audiences.</p>
	<h><strong>About Congressional hearings:</strong></h>
	<p>A Congressional hearing is called by Congress and serves as a forum to get facts and opinions from a witness. A witness is usually a politician, an academic, or a private corporate official. Hearings are held <em>to investigate suspicions of wrongdoing</em> or <em>to review the quality of federal programs and performance of government officials</em>. </p>
	<h><strong>Your task:</strong></h>
	<p>You are presented with <strong><em>question-response</em></strong> pairs from a congressional hearing.</p>
	For each <strong><em>question</em></strong>, your task is to judge the <strong><em>true intent of the questioner</em></strong></li>
	 	<ul>
	 		<li>Is the politican attacking or favoring the witness?</li>
	 	</ul>
	For each <strong><em>response</em></strong>, your task is to judge the <strong><em>true intent of the witness</em></strong></li>

<div id="instructions" class="panel-body">
<p>In this task, you are presented with a series of question-response pairs from a U.S. congressional hearing (in chronological order).</p>
<p>The questions are asked by a <strong><em>politician</em></strong>, a member of Congress. The responses to the questions are given by a <strong><em>witness</em></strong>.</p>
<p>People usually speak one at a time, and take <strong><em>turns</em></strong> speaking. Each turn in the conversation starts with the name of the speaker and their title.</p>

<ol>
<li><h><strong>Questioner Intent: How does the politician pose their question(s)?</strong></h></li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>includes leading questions, controversial assumptions, or attacks:</strong>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="exampleText">Chairman Hensarling: <em><u>Isn't it true</u></em>, Mr. Stumpf, that in the settlement, no one admits guilt?</span> (you believe the politician is leading the witness to an unfavorable 'yes' answer)</li>
				<li><span class="exampleText">Mr. Wilson: What changes need to be made to have <em><u>greater success</u></em> in countering Hezbollah?</span> (you believe the politician makes the controversial assumption that little or no success has been made in fighting Hezbollah)</li>
				<li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle('examplesLoaded');">More examples:</a></li>
				<div id="examplesLoaded" style="display: none">
					<li><span class="exampleText">Mr. Deutch: Do you think it would be reasonable for the members of this committee to conclude that the President <em><u>by first interfering in one investigation and then interfering in an investigation into himself</u></em> committed obstruction of justice?</span> (you believe the politician includes the controversial assumption that Trump interfered in investigations)</li>
				</div>
				</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>includes questions or statements favoring the witness:</strong>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="exampleText">Mr. Guthrie (to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook): I had a lot of people complain about ads but it is something I am willing to accept in return for a <em><u>free and valuable service</u></em>.

<p>Use <strong><em>your personal beliefs and experiences</em></strong> to make this judgment. Multiple choices may fit, but choose the one that fits best.</p>

								You believe the witness <strong><em>answers</strong></em> all reasonable questions in a straightforward manner. In the case of being asked multiple questions, you can decide whether it is reasonable to expect the witness to answer all or only some of the questions.
								<ul>
									<li>Q:  Mr. Cohen, who said that?</br>
									<span class="exampleText">Mr. Cohen: <em>I did.</em></span> (you believe Cohen directly answers the question)</li>

							<div id="descPart" style="display: none">
								You believe the witness provides a <strong><em>partial</em></strong> answer because you believe they either gave an <strong><em>incomplete</em></strong> answer or answered <strong><em>only some</em></strong> of the questions being asked.<br> 
								You may also assume the politician asks an <strong><em>implied</em></strong> question; that is, a question not explicitly asked but obvious from the context. For example, the question "Can you elaborate on that?" naturally implies the question "What other information do you have on that?". Responding with only "Yes" answers the literal question but doesn't answer the implied question.

											<li>Q: Would Don Jr. or Mr. Weisselberg have more information about that?</br>
												<span class="exampleText">Mr. Cohen: <em>Mr. Weisselberg for sure about the entire discussions, and Don Jr. would have cursory information.</em></span> (you believe Cohen doesn't answer the implied question <u>"<em>What</em> is the other information?"</u>, and instead only answers the literal question of whether or not they have information.)</li>
										</ul>
									<li type="circle"><strong>for other justified reason</strong></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Q: What are you looking for in the labor market? How much slack do we have left?</br>

										<li>Q: I understand that Facebook does not sell user data, per se, in the traditional sense. Why wasn't explaining what Facebook does with users' data higher priority for you as a cofounder and now as CEO?</br>
											<span class="exampleText">Mr. Zuckerberg: <em>Mr. Chairman, you are right that we don't sell any data, and I would say that we do try to explain what we do as time goes on.

												<span class="exampleText">Mr. Zuckerberg: Well, Mr. Chairman, I think we have evolved quite a bit as a company.

									<li type="circle"><strong>to be helpful or add critical details</strong> (for example, by including missing or useful information to better understand the answer)</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Q: Does that increased credit risk in the loan market pose systemic vulnerabilities?</br>
												<span class="exampleText">Mr. Powell: We don't believe it poses systemic kinds of risks, but we do think it poses a macroeconomic risk, particularly in the event of an economic downturn. These are companies that have borrowed in good times and borrowed high amounts of debt. And if there is a downturn, they will be less able to carry out their roles in the economy and that may have an amplification effect on a downturn.</span> (you believe Powell adds helpful and critical details to understand his nuanced answer)</li>

<p>Explain your choice for how the witness responded to the question and what you perceived to be the intent of the witness (that is, explain all your radio button selections for Witness Intent).</p>

<p>Because your choices are subjective, they will naturally often differ from another person's. Here is an example of choices and explanations given by two different people who have differing views on the witness. </p>
