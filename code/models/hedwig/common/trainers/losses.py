    Calculates the negative log likelihood using the logistic cumulative link

    See "On the consistency of ordinal regression methods", Pedregosa et. al.

    paywalls.
    Parameters
    ----------
    y_pred : torch.Tensor, [batch_size, num_classes]
        Predicted target class probabilities. float dtype.
    y_true : torch.Tensor, [batch_size, 1]
